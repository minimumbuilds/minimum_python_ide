Version: v0.1.2

## Requirements

- Docker

## Clone the repo

	git clone https://github.com/minimumbuilds/minimum_python_ide.git

## Make it Personal 

	make personal

This will create a user (mbuilds) in the container with matching UID/GID of the current user.  

## Install nerd-fonts on the HOST

If you want the fancy icons to work properly, you'll need to install them.

For full instructions go to https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

On Ubuntu, you can also:

	git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts.git

Then simply click on the fonts you'd like to install in the ``patched-fonts`` directory.

## Run
	docker run -it --rm -p 1337:1337 --user mbuilds -v $PWD:/repos vim_ide vim /repos


This will launch the IDE in the /repos dir in the current working directory. 

## Usage

- ``<F2>`` Buffer prev 
- ``<F3>`` Buffer next 
- ``<F6>`` toggles Livedown preview.   Open a markdown file, hit F7 and you'll get a Live preview of your Markown file. You will need to open a browser to ``localhost:1337``.  The preview will update immediately on write.
- ``<F7>`` (with a python file open) lint the current file & display output in a new window.  Saving a file will have the same effect.
- ``<F8>`` toggles the righthand tag bar.  This will display a structured view of a program.  It does this by creating a sidebar that displays the ctags-generated tags of the current file, ordered by their scope. This means that for example methods in C++ are displayed under the class they are defined in.
- ``<ctrl-p>`` Fuzzy file search finder: https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim
